  <p>
    JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
    As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.
