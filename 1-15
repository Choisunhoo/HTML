  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup lanuage for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
    Web browsers revceive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the documents

  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page.
    It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>

  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
    As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.

  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.
    It is an information space where documents and other web resources can be accessed through the Internet using a web browser.
    The Web has changed people's lives immeasurably. It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact on the Internet.
    It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991.

  <p>
     Web resources may be any type of downloadable media.
     Web pages are documents interconnected by hypertext links formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
     The HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits users to navigate to other web resources.
     In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components, which are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.
    Web applications are web pages that function as application software.
